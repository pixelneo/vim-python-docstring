# vim-python-docstring
This is a plugin to Vim and NeoVim for creating of docstrings. 

## What it does
Docstrings for methods will contain a **list of parameters and their type hints**, **list of raised exceptions** and whether the method **yields** or **raises**.

Class docstring will have a **list of atributes**. 

![usage](https://media.giphy.com/media/SUtkPJMUd75Vm1UIxG/giphy.gif)

It uses Python's [ast](https://docs.python.org/3/library/ast.html) library for parsing code. 
This makes it quite **robust** solution, which can handle function signature such as 

~~~{.python}
def foo(a='foo(c,d)',
    b,
    z):
        pass
~~~


## Installation
If you use for example Vundle, add `Plugin 'pixelneo/vim-python-docstring'` to your `.vimrc` file.

Alternatively if you have Vim 8 and newer, you can clone this repository into `~/.vim/pack/<whatever>/start/` where `<whatever>` is *whatever* you want it to be.

If you have **neovim**, install python provider first: `pip3 install pynvim`.

## Usage
The plugin has only commands which you can map however you like (i use `<leader>ss` for `:Docstring`).

1. Place cursor at the first line of the object (`def ...` of `class ...`) for which you want to create a docstring
2. Then type `:Docstring` or different command

The plugin uses these commands:

| Command       | Description |
|---------------|-------------|
| Docstring     | Create full docstring 
| DocstringTypes| Just like `:Docstring` but includes type hints
| DocstringLine | Create empty one-line docstring  

## Options:
There are things you can set.

### The `g:vpd_indent` option
String which you use to indent your code.

Default: `'    '` (4 spaces).

~~~{viml}
let g:vpd_indent = '    '
~~~

### The `g:python_style` option
Which docstring style you wish to use.

Default: `'google'`

Possible values = [`'google'`, `'numpy'`, `'rest'`, `'epytext'`]

~~~{viml}
let g:python_style = 'google'
~~~

## Development
Pull requests are welcome as are feature request and issue reports.

You can encounter some situations in which the plugin may not work as expected.
Most notably there *may* be issues if your keyword for refering to instance is not `self` -- in such case it *may* be added to the list of arguments.

There are [more unsolved issues](ISSUES.md).
